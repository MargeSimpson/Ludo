Game Story
=====

Once upon a time... somewhere in Bulgaria lived Khan Telerig.
He was a wise and brave Khan.

But one day... his Castle was attacked.
By black black Ninjas. Actually - they were so fast, that no one could see them. They were magically invisible!
Khan Telerig decided that It would be more wisely to give up and ally with the enemies. 

So, Ninjas retain the name of the wise Khan and since these ancient times, they use the Bulgarian Telerig's Castle and Valley to train the best Ninjas in the world.
